    <h3>Become a Developer</h3>
    <p>
        Being a developer requires many skills, and there are two major factors in developing a skill: effective practice and support from senior developers. You need to maximise both of these to help you become the best developer you can be. There are three good ways to make sure that you’re on a fast track to starting your developer career.

    <p>Lastly, web development is one of those disciplines that “where there’s a will, there’s a way” definitely rings true. It’s one of those areas where, if you’re willing to put in the work, the rest usually takes care of itself.Whether you’re an experienced developer, or a newbie, there’s always something new to learn or practice. Among the best out there is David Walsh, who works for Mozilla. David places practice above theory in order of importance. He believes that developers should never fear experimentation and always be willing to dabble in unknown areas. He’s also a stern believer in the fail-fast Agile methodology. We’ve actually included his blog in the list below!</p>

        <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
